        Satoru Gojo is a fictional character from the anime <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujutsu_Kaisen">Jujutsu Kaisen</a></em>. He is a special-grade jujutsu sorcerer and works as a teacher at Tokyo Jujutsu High School, where he mentors the main protagonist, Yuji Itadori. Gojo is widely considered to be the strongest character in the Jujutsu Kaisen universe because of his Limitless and Six Eyes abilities.
